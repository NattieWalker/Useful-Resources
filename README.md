# Useful-Resources
A list of useful Resources that will help me reach my programming goals.

Some are specific to a langaue and others will be a broad tutorial. (e.g. sOmething on best practicies of design).

Feel free to add more resources but please be mindful of the different files for different resource types. I am going to be my best to keep this as organized as possible.
